# Advent of Code Day 9 - Rust Version
[Link to Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Again the Rust version of my Python solution. As in the Python solution I have
tried to make the logging a little bit better and added test with testdata
given by the examples on the Advent of Code page. To get the debug output
one hast to run with environment variables RUST_LOG=debug, for simply the
solution RUST_LOG=info.
